This is a repository to completement the repository hosted on nitrc https://www.nitrc.org/projects/isc-toolbox/
Please consider the site on NITRC as the primary repository for the toolbox. However, some of the documentation has been hard 
to find from the NITC site so I upload it here

This Matlab toolbox performs inter-subject correlation (ISC) based analysis of fMRI data and includes a GUI for the visualization of the resulting thresholded statistical maps.

The toolbox contains functions to carry out various ISC based analysis such as mean, frequency band, time window and phase synchronization ISC analysis. All analyses can be run from a GUI. Isc-toolbox includes also automated support for Slurm/SGE based grid environments.

A set of visualization tools - particularly designed for ISC analyses - are integrated to the GUI. Visualization tools contain functionalities to which standard functional neuroimaging packages are difficult to adapt.
